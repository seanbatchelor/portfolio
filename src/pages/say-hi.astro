					<p>For 10 years, I have I helped multi-disciplinary teams identify and act upon insights to solve problems.</p>
					<p>Previous roles have been with purpose-led companies, including Cecil – A platform for accessing high quality nature data, Hatch – an early career talent marketplace and FreshBooks – an accounting platform for small service-based businesses.</p>
					<p>I have also led the design of new products and services for some of Australia and Canada’s biggest brands at BCG Digital Ventures, Sydney and Fjord, Toronto.</p>

					<p>I have build a strong generalist skillset, and am used to working in ambiguous, fast-moving environments.</p>
					<p>I seek impactful and practical design solutions, informed by customer insight, and executed with finesse.</p>
					<p>Connect on Linkedin or send me an email.</p>
					<p>I also publish some more esoteric takes on design phenomena in an occasional newsletter.</p>
