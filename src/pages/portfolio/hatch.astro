	<ProjectSection image={'/images/projects/hatch/Problem-1.png'} imageAlt="Hatch problem" subheading="Early-career hiring relies on CVs that poorly represent motivation and long-term fit">
		<ContentColumn position={1}>
			Graduates struggle to communicate motivation and transferable skills through traditional CVs, while employers rely on CV screening as a primary filter for entry-level roles. For candidates with limited experience, this is a weak signal of alignment or potential.
		</ContentColumn>
		<ContentColumn position={2}>
			The result is inefficiency and missed matches. Hatch sets out to redesign the hiring journey around motivations, strengths, and values, rather than credentials alone.

		<ContentColumn position={1}>
			The product evolved into a talent marketplace centred on candidate motivations and employer culture. I led design for employer profiles, applicant shortlists, and iterative improvements to the candidate profile experience.
		</ContentColumn>
		<ContentColumn position={2}>
			Working closely with founders, engineering, and data science, I ran targeted research and usability testing to validate changes before release and ensure both sides of the marketplace felt coherent and aligned.

		<ContentColumn position={1}>
			The platform required a single sign-up and sign-in experience that accommodated both candidates and employers, introducing conditional paths and deep-linking scenarios.
		</ContentColumn>
		<ContentColumn position={2}>
			I collaborated with engineering from early solution design through to high-fidelity prototypes, ensuring the final experience felt simple to users while remaining technically robust and scalable.

			Following the strategic shift, I led a positioning initiative with founders and growth team members, drawing on principles from April Dunford to clarify competitive alternatives, differentiated value, and category narrative.
