  headline="With a design mindset, creative problem solving can be applied to all aspects of a product concept"
  intro="Later Daily Soaps is a personal project from 2018, that I brought to life to validate its potential as a business and experiment with the design process and tools. Further research, value proposition testing, prototyping, live experiments, product R&D and commercial analysis would be required in the next stages."

  <ProjectSection image='/images/projects/later/Friction-opportunity.png' imageAlt="Problem and opportunity" subheading="I tested personal assumptions through customer interviews and competitor research">
    <ContentColumn position={1}>
      I surveyed peoples preferences and selection criteria when buying soap. I identified key insights to guide concept development.
    </ContentColumn>

  <ProjectSection image='/images/projects/later/Positioning.png' imageAlt="Competitive analysis" subheading="I used competitive analysis frameworks to identify market opportunities and ways to differentiate">
    <ContentColumn position={1}>
      The gaining popularity of direct-to-consumer and subscription models provided an opportunity to compete by innovating in the way people buy and use soap.
    </ContentColumn>

  <ProjectSection image='/images/projects/later/Concept-development.png' imageAlt="Concept development" subheading="Mapping the purchase, use and repurchase journey exposed areas to innovate">
    <ContentColumn position={1}>
      I leveraged well known frameworks such as the lean canvas and service maps to bring the idea to life, refining towards a clear value proposition.

  <ProjectSection image='/images/projects/later/Art-direction-and-product-design.png' imageAlt="Art direction and product design" subheading="Visual brainstorming techniques led to a product name and a working-brand">
    <ContentColumn position={1}>
      The name is a play on the word "lather", with "daily soaps" reinforcing that soap can be an everyday pleasure.
    </ContentColumn>
    <ContentColumn position={2}>
      The brand needed to be distinctive even when its packaging had been removed so I used 3D software to design the bar itself.

  <ProjectSection image='/images/projects/later/User-experience.png' imageAlt="User experience" subheading="The experience needed to consider the cyclical customer journey beyond the digital touch-points">
    <ContentColumn position={1}>
      The user experience goal is to help users confidently purchase a subscription. A calculator helps users understand the amount of soap they will require and the cost, based on the type of soap they want and number of people in their household.

  <ProjectSection image='/images/projects/later/UI-Design.png' imageAlt="UI design" subheading="Product shots were rendered in 3D software, with illustrations highlighting the product value proposition">
    <ContentColumn position={1}>
      The colour palette and raw illustration style, balances the modern typography and crisp 3D renders.
    </ContentColumn>
  </ProjectSection>

  <ProjectSection image='/images/projects/later/soap_survey.png' imageAlt="Concept testing" subheading="A landing page and short survey helped gain an initial signal on the strengths and weaknesses of the product assumptions">
    <ContentColumn position={1}>
      The survey suggested that whilst a subscription model may be very interesting to some, many are tied to liquid soap or a specific brand, and arenâ€™t ready to change for convenience, price or environmental factors.
    </ContentColumn>
    <ContentColumn position={2}>
      I found that more assurance of the quality of the soap itself is also required before customers would commit to a subscription.
